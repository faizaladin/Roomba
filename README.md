# Roomba

move.py is a script that has the roomba move in a spiral manner initially until it detects an obstacle. Once it detects an obstacle, it starts to move randomly within the colony space. 

ROBOTICS.html is a webpage that shows the process of how we made the roomba as well as videos of it working.
