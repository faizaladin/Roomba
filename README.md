# Roomba

Our goal for this project is to create an autonomous vacuum that can clean in any environment it is placed in, similar and inspired by a Roomba. This entails the robot to be able to detect and avoid obstacles that it cannot clear, such as toys or certain furniture, and detect obstacles it can go under and clean, like table chairs and things of the like. Our robot will rely on 2D-LIDAR to sense and create a map of its surroundings, as well as know its own location in a given room. The LIDAR will also perform avoidance in a situation where it bumps into an obstacle or wall and needs to pivot. It will use two wheels as its effectors, and have a vacuum box mounted under it to collect the debris it passes over. Lastly, the robot will move in a spiral manner where it starts in the center and works its way through the space avoiding obstacles.
